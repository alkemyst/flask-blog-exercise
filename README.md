# Exercise to build a blog in flask

This is my exercise in implementing the example described here:
https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-make-a-web-application-using-flask-in-python-3

## Setting up the application
First the app needs the correct environment. This can be created with the following script:
```
./setup_application.sh
```
Then our app needs a back-end database that must be setup once with the follwing script:
```
./setup_database.sh
```
